# Cybersecurity-Projects
Â¡Hi! My name is Camilo and this repository is a hands-on cybersecurity projects, covering network analysis, vulnerability assessments, and exploitation techniques. I created to build my skills for a security analyst position

List

1- Traffic and network analysis (Proyect #1)
2- Vulnerabilities Scan (Proyect #2)
3- Proof of concept(PoC) (Proyect #3)

Proyects description
1- Trafffic and network analysis
This proyect focuses in the analysis and captute of network traffic, using tools such as nmap to scan and wireshark to capture and analyze packets

2- Vulnerabilities scan 
I conducted a detailed investigation into known vulnerabilities, using public databases like NVD and documenting each finding with its respective CVSS score.

3- Proof of concept(PoC)
In this project, I used a Metasploit Framework exploit to gain access to a vulnerable system, demonstrating the importance of the proof of concept.
